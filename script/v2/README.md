# App building script
This script automates the building of a flutter project in all supported platforms. 
## Usage
To build your flutter project for the different plattforms, just launch the 'main_scr.sh' script. For each platform (android, ios, etc.) it will create the app file and an additional html file linking to it. 
Keep in mind available target platforms depends in the tools you have installed on your machine. For example, you can't build your project for Ios unless you have xcode installed. The tools required to build for every platform can be found at flutter official website (https://docs.flutter.dev/) under the Deployment tab.
